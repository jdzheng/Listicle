          Crunchy and perfectly seasoned. These Buttload of Fries are a must have if you find
          yourself in Rowland Height's famous "Yes Plaza." These fries have a secret seasoning
          that even the workers themselves don't know. There is initial sweet taste followed
          by a salty after taste along with a mixture of other spices. Even more so, the crunchy
          outer coating creates a nice composition with the soft potato. Although the potato
          flavor may be masked by the seasoning, the overal taste cannot be matched by any other
          late night snack food place.

          You may have seen donut ice-cream sandwiches at the dining halls, but nothing
          compares to the "Milky Bun" that they serve at Afters. Originally opened in
          Irvine, CA, the ice-cream shop recently opened up a branch in Rowland just a
          year ago. They serve a variety of interesting flavors from Thai Tea and Vietnamese
          Coffee to Cookie Monster and Churro.

          These unique flavors placed between warm, fluffy and freshly glazed donuts offer
          the perfect dessert or afternoon snack. You truly do leave your diet there.

        <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kang+Ho+Dong+Baekjeong+(Rowland+Heights)/@33.9946577,-117.8925316,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c32a59e4171043:0x5ada01a262e60d19!8m2!3d33.9946577!4d-117.8903429">

        <p>
          If you're looking for quality Korean BBQ then you've found the right place. Kang
          Ho Dong Baekjeong offers a unique KBBQ dining experience as opposed to other locations
          in Rowland Heights. Rather than an all-you-can-eat menu, Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong only
          offers an order by plate option. Although more expensive than typical KBBQ restuarants,
          the quality of meat is definitely unbeatable. You won't regret your decision once you
          see the marbling on the rib-eye.

          Did I mention, that they also have corn-cheese on the side, along with steamed-egg and
          a variety of delicious ban-chan!
